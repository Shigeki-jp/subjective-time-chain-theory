# Resolving Time Paradoxes via a Blockchain-Structured Subjective Time Chain Model

## Abstract
Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to address the nature of time travel and the resulting time paradoxes. One such paradox, the grandfather paradox, is often explained by the many-worlds interpretation, in which the timeline branches into a parallel world—avoiding paradoxes by separating causality. However, this explanation introduces unrealistic assumptions such as the existence of parallel universes. Another example is the Novikov self-consistency principle, which states that any actions taken by a time traveler were always part of history, thereby preventing paradoxes. Still, the assumption that a person with free will could return to the past and cause no change contradicts our intuitive understanding of causality and chaos, such as in the butterfly effect.

In this paper, I propose the Subjective Time Chain Theory, a novel model inspired by blockchain architecture that represents time as a linear, immutable sequence of subjective events. This model introduces the concept of an individual "subjective chain"—a chain of time blocks from birth to death—where each new experience is added sequentially. In accordance with the immutability of the blockchain, any alteration of the past is fundamentally impossible. Instead, what is typically referred to as “time travel to the past” is reinterpreted as a new future event, appended as a forward-moving block. This preserves causal consistency while avoiding paradoxes and maintaining the chronological integrity of the subjective chain.

## 1. Introduction
Time travel has long fascinated physicists, philosophers, and science fiction writers alike. Yet, despite its cultural pervasiveness, the fundamental issues of causality and paradoxes remain unresolved. Central to this dilemma is the time paradox, most famously embodied in the grandfather paradox, where a traveler goes back in time and prevents their own existence.

Conventional solutions, such as the many-worlds interpretation or the Novikov self-consistency principle, rely either on speculative metaphysics or restrictive determinism. These explanations often fail to align with human intuition, particularly the idea of free will and the sensitivity of causality illustrated by the butterfly effect.

To provide a new framework for resolving time paradoxes, this paper introduces a novel theoretical model based on the mechanics of blockchain systems. This model, termed the Subjective Time Chain Theory (STCT), reimagines the passage of time as a series of immutable blocks representing individual experiences, which are strictly added in a forward direction. In this framework, events interpreted as time travel to the past are instead logged as new forward-moving blocks, thus recontextualizing them as part of the future rather than a contradiction of the past.
