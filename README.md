# subjective-time-chain-theory
Exploring time paradoxes using a linear, observer-based time model inspired by blockchain.

## Overview

This project introduces the **Subjective Time Chain Theory**, a novel conceptual framework that models personal time experience as a blockchain-like chain of events. It aims to explore and potentially resolve classical **time paradoxes** — such as the "grandfather paradox" — by representing temporal transitions through **subjective, unidirectional chains** and special blocks called **E-blocks**.

The theory offers a fresh perspective on time travel, combining principles from **blockchain structure**, **subjective perception**, and **philosophy of time**.

This repository contains both:
- the **research paper**, and
- a **Rust-based simulation** demonstrating the logic of time traversal and chain generation.
